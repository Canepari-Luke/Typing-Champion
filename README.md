# Overview

The main goal of this site was to increase our knowledge and experience regarding web development. We wanted a way for users to be able to interact with each other and build a sense of online community.

We wanted to make the site something fun with a healthy competitive spirit. We also wanted the site to hold educational value. To accomplish this, we designed a typing game that collects player/user statistics and has a leaderboard. There is also a level progression system. This way, users will be able to track their own progress while also comparing their improvement to others.

The ultimate purpose of writing this software was to be a personal project for our team to build our teamwork and overall knowledge and skill in web development. Specifically, in JavaScript.

# Development Environment

Vue.js was used to help organize and link files/components for different elements of the site.

We used MySQL for the backend.

We used HTML and CSS for aspects of the front end. We also used JavaScript for the game logic.
For the backend, we used Python.

# Useful Websites

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/vue/)

# Future Work

- We need to finish the game logic and ensure that all the vue.js files are properly linked.
- We need to ensure that the user data is properly recorded and sent to the back end.
- We need to make sure that the front end can retrieve all user data from the back end.
